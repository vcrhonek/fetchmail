These are scripts or configuration snippets to help you running
fetchmail in special situations.

Note: you're on your own using these -- the fetchmail team undertakes no
efforts in understanding them, they are just passing them along.

### 0*.html:
Messages from the archives of the old fetchmail-friends mailing list,
for off-line reading.

### maildaemon:
Larry Fahnoe wrote this for driving fetchmail from cron.  It may be useful if
you want to force a PPP link up and then poll for mail at specified times.
I have rearranged it slightly to make it easier to configure.

### novell:

Some mail from Dan Newcombe describing how to write a procmail rule that
will domainify Novell server names.

### login & logout:

These are intended to help if you typically have multiple logins active.
Here's the script composer's original README:

	Please find attached 2 files, ~/.bash_login & ~/.bash_logout
	What these do is try to keep track of WHO is the process/tty
	that ran fetchmail in daemon mode.  I tried to use the bash
	Variable PPID, but when using xterm the PPID is set to the
	xterm's pid not the bash shell's pid so....

	They have been lightly tested.

	Any comments...

Doug Carter <dougc@canus.com> suggests this instead:

Add the following to your login script. (.ie .bash_profile, .profile, etc)

LOGINS=`who | grep $USER | wc -l`
if [ $LOGINS = 1 ]; then
    /usr/bin/fetchmail > /dev/null 2>&1
fi

Then add the following to your logout script. (.ie .bash_logout, etc)

LOGINS=`who | grep $USER | wc -l`
if [ $LOGINS = 1 ]; then
    /usr/bin/fetchmail -q > /dev/null 2>&1
fi

### ip-up:

A note from James Stevens about using fetchmail in an ip-up script without
disabling timeouts.

### runfetchmail:

A shellscript front end for fetchmail that mails you various statistics on
the downloaded mail and the state of your folders.  A good example of what
you can do with your own front end.

### mailqueue.pl:

This script will connect to your ISP (if not already connected),
send any outgoing mail and retrieve any incoming mail.  If this
program made the connection, it will also break the connection
when it is done.  By Bill Adams, <bill@evil.inetarena.com>.  The
latest version is carried at <http://evil.inetarena.com/>.

### getmail/gotmail:

These scripts are front ends for fetchmail in daemon mode that can gather
log statistics and generate text or HTML reports.  See README.getmail for
details.  Scripts by Thomas Nesges <ThomaNesges@TNT-Computer.de>.

### fetchmail-oauth2.py

Script to obtain oauth2 access tokens that "fetchmail --auth oauthbearer"
expects in place of the password.  See --help and comments in the
script, as well as fetchmail --auth documentation.

### mold-remover.py

A short python script to remove old read mail from a pop3 mailserver.
Dovetails with fetchmail with keep option.  Run it as a cron job.

### PopDel.py

PopDel stands for Pop Delete; this program deletes selected email from a
pop mail server. (By Richard Harris, improved by Joshua Crawford.)

### fetchmail.logrotate (added 2007-01-14, --ma)

A logrotate configuration file developped by Daniel Leidert for Debian,
when he wanted to use /var/log/fetchmail instead of the usual syslog.
It probably needs to be adjusted for use on other systems.

### rawlog.patch (added 2011-06-17, --ma)

A patch against fetchmail 6.3.20 to allow creating a raw socket log if
configured through an environment variable, to assist debugging and
troubleshooting.  Documentation at the beginning of the file.

### gai (added 2013-02-03, --ma)

A trivial getaddrinfo() program to check the getaddrinfo() call from the
system, as a research tool for the fetchmail developers.

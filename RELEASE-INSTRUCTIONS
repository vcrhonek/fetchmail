To do a release:

- Update NEWS, configure.ac, and fetchmail.man, with release number & date.

- Run "perl dist-tools/makerelease.pl" - this entails "make distcheck".

- Commit all files to the VCS (Git).

- Tag the new release with a signed tag.

- Edit website/index.html for the new tarballs and NEWS files and last update,
  and upload with website/host-scripts/upload-website.sh, and commit the changes to Git.

- These would be done automatically by makerelease.pl:
  - Upload sig and tarball to ~/public_html/fetchmail/
  - Upload sig and tarball to sourceforge, per
    <https://sourceforge.net/p/forge/documentation/Release%20Files%20for%20Download/#rsync>

- Update the fetchmail website for version, link to release nodes
  (update release_id) and last update, commit, and upload.

- On sourceforge.net, mark the new release as the default download.
